# Zakaria El Fettahi

Not the best “coder”, but I know programming methodology.  
I know a bit of Python, C, C++, and I once survived a full-stack web dev project.  

Currently just trying to:  
- Improve my coding skills by actively learning.
- build a machine learning model for my 498 class.
- GET AN INTERNSHIP 🙏
